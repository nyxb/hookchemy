In JavaScript, we have two primitives for scheduling something in the future based on an amount of time:

- setTimeout
- setInterval

setTimeout is great for one-off events, and setInterval is great for things that happen on a fixed scheduleâ€¦ but what if we want something to happen a bit more spontaneously?

This hook is great for animations and microinteractions. If you're generating particles for a confetti or firework effect, having a random delay between each particle can add a lot of life to the effect.
